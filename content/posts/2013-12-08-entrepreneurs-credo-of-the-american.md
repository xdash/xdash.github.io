I do not choose to be a common person.  
It is my right to be uncommon—if I can.  
I seek opportunity—not security.  
I do not wish to be a kept citizen,  
humbled and dulled by having the state look after me.  
I want to take the calculated risk,  
to dream and to build,  
to fail and to succeed.  
I refuse to barter incentive for a dole;  
I prefer the challenges of life to the guaranteed existence;  
the thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of Utopia.  
I will not trade my freedom for beneficence  
nor my dignity for a handout.  
I will never cower before any master  
nor bend to any threat.  
It is my heritage to stand erect, proud, and unafraid;  
to think and act for myself;  
to enjoy the benefit of my creations;  
and to face the world boldly  
and say:  
&#8220;This, with God’s help, I have done.&#8221;

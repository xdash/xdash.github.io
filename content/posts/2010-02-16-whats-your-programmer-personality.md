My <a href="http://www.doolwind.com/blog/programmer-personality-test/" target="_blank">programmer personality type</a> is: **PHSB**

  * **You’re a Planner.**

You may be slow, but you’ll usually find the best solution. If something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right.

// 慢工出细活，磨刀不误砍柴工。

  * **You like coding at a High level.**

The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.

// 其实是底层的我压根不会。

  * **You work best in a Solo situation.**

The best way to program is by yourself. There’s no communication problems, you know every part of the code allowing you to write the best programs possible.

// 喜欢僻静，喜欢熬夜。

  * **You are a liBeral programmer.**

Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We’re not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.

// 喜欢简洁，留白，清晰的界面，完善的注释。

// Another interesting test indicates what type of character are you , mine being **Universal** , <a href="http://pentagram.com/what-type-are-you/" target="_blank">Click Here</a> **.**

// Just for fun.
